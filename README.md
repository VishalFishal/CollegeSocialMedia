# CollegeSocialMedia
A web app that displays a student's college's important social media posts across platforms at one portal. It uses Puppeteer to scrape the posts in Instagram and Linkedin, saving post details to SQLite via Prisma and images locally. Express serves these scraped posts to the front end.

## Things to work on:
1. Session handling with the login system.
2. Linkedin is being funny and skips posts when scraping for some reason.
3. Support for other colleges via the email provided.
4. Segregation of colleges.
5. Using brand APIs.
6. Moving away from SQLite.
